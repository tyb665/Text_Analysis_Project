Increased frequency of extreme weather events, from floods to droughts, could cause disruption in our supply chain and impact the sourcing of raw materials, as well as the production and distribution of finished goods. Increased regulation and more stringent environmental standards could impact our business by affecting production costs and flexibility of operations. Our industry is sustained by many agricultural and manufacturing communities around the world. Failure to support them in preserving key skills and building more sustainable livelihoods could cause social, economic and operational challenges, ranging from community tensions and disruption to production, to a reduced talent pool."

These include increased frequency/intensity of extreme weather events and chronic climate changes which can disrupt our operations and compromise the safety of our team members, customers, supply chain and the food we sell; changes to government policy, law and regulation, which can result in increased costs to operate and potential for litigation; and failure to meet expectations of stakeholders resulting in reputational damage."
