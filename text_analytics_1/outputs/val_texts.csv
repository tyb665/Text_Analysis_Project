8.2 Generation Portfolio Metrics AGL has heavily invested and continues to invest in renewable energy generation. In the past decade AGL has increased its renewable energy generation fourfold to over 4.4 TWh. AGL's percentage of generation from renewables has also grown over this period. Table 15 below outlines the changes in AGL's proportion of generation and capacity from renewables.
"As part of this process of transforming society as a whole Deutsche Borse Group is engaged in a continuous exchange with internal and external stakeholders on sustainability, climate action and sustainable finance. It sees this not only as part of its strategic approach but also as managing climate-related opportunities and risks."
"At the request of the Board's Responsible Banking, Sustainability and Culture Committee and the Board Supervision, Regulation and Compliance Committee, a joint session was held to review the current and emerging risks in the oil & gas and mining & steel portfolios of the Santander Group. This provided a good opportunity to deliberate the issues facing these sectors with independent board members that brought complementary skills and approaches to the discussion."
"We recognise the importance of disclosing to investors how we are ensuring that our material capital expenditure and investments align with the Paris Goals. This includes each material investment in the exploration, acquisition or development of fossil fuel (including thermal and coking coal) production, resources and reserves, as well as in resources, reserves and technologies associated with the transition to a low carbon economy."
"Emission sources not reported This section of the report details the emission sources on which we have not reported and provides the reasons behind our decisions. Only a minority of the offices we operate directly make use of gas and we have included this in our emissions from combustion of fuel. We do not have distinct data on heat/steam for our other offices as this is most likely embedded in the office service charges that we pay. As a result, we have not currently reported on purchased heat or steam. In future we will devise a methodology to estimate the emissions associated with heating requirements for which we are responsible."
"For a small number of companies that were very close to the threshold, BNP Paribas Asset Management conducted analysis and engagement to encourage these companies to improve their decarbonisation targets - and these companies will be subject to annual monitoring."
"S&P 500 Environmental, Social, and Governance Index In May 2019, our Indices Division expanded its Core Environmental, Social, and Governance offering, with the launch of a global suite of Environmental, Social, and Governance Indices which includes the S&P 500 Environmental, Social, and Governance Index. The objectives of the S&P 500 Environmental, Social, and Governance Index are to provide a similar risk/return profile to the S&P 500 and to avoid companies that are not managing their business in line with Environmental, Social, and Governance principles."
"In 2019, AP6 compiled its first high-level analysis of physical climate risks in the portfolio. Although it does not go into great depth, it does indicate that there are medi- um-high risks in nearly half of the portfolio. It is not currently possible for AP6 to, at the portfolio level, assess other climate-related risks like changes in consumer behavior or more regulation of products and emissions."
"IFC is helping reverse that decline. In 2018, we launched a Maximizing Finance for Development initiative — working with other members of the World Bank Group — to finance a $12 million solar project in Gaza to ease the energy shortage. The 7-megawatt rooftop solar-power plant will provide critical energy to 32 factories in the Gaza Industrial Estate — much more cheaply than before. The project will create around 800 jobs."
"Ralph Izzo has been a catalyst for climate action since assuming this position in 2007. He has been a respected voice among energy industry leaders on the need for comprehensive climate change policies, such as a nationwide price on carbon. As chairman of the Nuclear Energy Institute, he has advocated for policies to preserve the nation's fleet of existing nuclear power plants, which provide more than half of our carbon-free electricity. Izzo also advocates for climate action through organizations such as the CEO"
"Considering the expectations and perspectives of our stakeholders, for the purpose of strengthening our environmental and societal considerations in making investment and financing decisions, we previously established a policy on initiatives involving sectors which have a high possibility of contributing to adverse environmental and social impacts. In April 2020, to more thoroughly reflect the tenets of our Human Rights Policy and Environmental Policy, we revised the policy to be comprehensive in prohibiting investment and financing in such initiatives regardless of sector, as well as points of caution ('Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity'). (Figures 13 and 14)"
"Principle 4 - Implementation Organisational structures, business policies, processes and resources availability should be reviewed and enhanced to ensure effective integration of climate strategy into the operation and corporate development of an AI."
"Insights or commitments we have gained from these early customer conversations include: Energy: our engagement in this sector has initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations; however, we are broadening this to include major upstream oil and gas producing customers."
"The Trustee has a preference for engagement, rather than exclusion, as a method in encouraging greater disclosures and practices with regard to climate-related risks. Two examples of such engagements are:"
"When these damages are uninsured – and therefore borne by households, businesses or public authorities – this affects financial institutions’ exposure to these parties. The second type of risk, transition risk, is the result of the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. Climate policy, technological developments and changing consumer preferences may cause the value of loans and investments in sectors and companies that emit large quantities of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases to decrease much faster than previously expected. Underestimating this risk could lead to sudden and significant losses in the financial sector. Such a collapse is what is known as a"
United Nations Environment Programme FI LENDING PILOT CASE STUDY: TD and Bloomberg Testing Geospatial Mapping for Physical Risk Assessment1 TD collaborated with Bloomberg and Acclimatise to use an innovative geospatial solution for assessing physical risks of climate change (from both incremental changes and extreme weather events) to borrower credit ratings within the bank's lending portfolio.
S&P Global has developed a suite of products across its underlying business units that help clients in this transition and will continue to invest in innovative solutions that power sustainable markets of the future.
"PROHIBIT COAL GENERATION: There is no denying that coal is on the decline around the world. Even with artificial incentives being set up to extend the lives of coal plants in supply-strapped regions, it is clear that no amount of subsidies or lobbying will slow the global transition. The problem is with the laggards, certain regions that have been too slow in realizing the true cost of coal to their citizens and natural environment, and therefore have dangerously prolonged the decline."
"ING issued a dual tranche five-year EUR 500 million and three-year USD 800 million green bond. This is ING’s first-ever green bond transaction. The money raised will go to projects in six categories eligible under ING’s newly established green bond framework, including renewable energy, green buildings, public transport, waste, water and energy efficiency. We have chosen a broad selection of sectors, which reflects our ambition to support sustainability across all industries and sectors."
" The Local Government Coastal Hazard Climate Adaptation Fund ($4 million per annum over three years) was established to assist local councils with the development of coastal hazard adaptation strategies and coastal adaptation pilot projects. In addition, $3 million in funding was provided for the development and implementation of a Queensland Climate Adaptation Strategy, in collaboration with local councils and other key stakeholder groups ($1 million per annum over three years)."
"Deep dive analysis of the oil and gas, mining and steel sectors At the request of the Board's Responsible Banking, Sustainability and Culture Committee and the Board Supervision, Regulation and Compliance Committee, a joint session was held to review the current and emerging risks in the oil & gas and mining & steel portfolios of the Santander Group."
"In our Electricity Transmission business, we propose £1.35 billion of expenditure to connect new generation and transport electricity across the country to where it is consumed, connect us to neighbouring electricity markets and support the Electricity System Operator in being able to operate a zero-carbon electricity system by 2025. Whilst consistent with Ofgem’s business plan criteria, we recognise that these investments alone are insufficient to deliver net zero targets and have therefore proposed whole system options to accelerate progress towards net zero, for example through ultra-rapid vehicle charging at motorway service areas. As the optimal path to achieving net zero is unclear, we developed a series of uncertainty mechanisms that allow our plans to flex to deliver against the range of low-carbon system developments our customers could bring forward."
"A challenge for today, not tomorrow Aviva has a long-term commitment to tackle climate change. In 2015, we announced an investment target of £500 million annually for the next five years in low-carbon infrastructure. We also set an associated carbon savings target for this investment of 100,000 tonnes of CO2e annually. In 2017, Aviva Investors signed £527.5 million of new investment in wind, solar, biomass and energy efficiency. Aviva continues to manage the impact of our business on the environment. Our Corporate Responsibility, Environment and Climate change business standard focuses on the most material operational environmental impacts, which we have identified as greenhouse gas emissions. We report these as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2e) on an operational basis in respect of Aviva’s Group-wide operations. See the table below."
"An internal analysis of the generation fuel mix associated with our power utilities portfolio indicates approximately a third of our exposure is low-carbon, not inclusive of our $9.4 billion portfolio of tax equity investments 16F 17 in wind and solar projects throughout the U.S. We have dramatically reduced exposure to companies focused on coal extraction, as evidenced by the fact that pure play coal extraction now only represents $155 million of our energy sector exposure (or 0.4%), down nearly 80% from $762 million at FYE 2015."
"We are therefore focusing on sustainably sourcing major commodities like palm oil and cane sugar, as well as partnering and collaborating with suppliers, peers, and other stakeholders to implement and influence better practices on-farm."
"Global climate change could exacerbate certain of the threats facing our business, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events referred to in Performance of critical infrastructure in this section 9. In addition, increases in energy prices are partly influenced by government policies to address climate change which, combined with a growing data demand that increases our energy requirements, could increase our energy costs beyond our current expectations."
"For an airline, fuel right-sizing can largely be seen as a capital allocation strategy. We have a consistent strategy of investing in fuel-saving new airframes and engines, which are the largest factors in fuel consumption. In 2018, we made two major announcements related to fuel burn: A220s and New Engine Options. More information on these can be found on page 23."
"We do not provide normalised figures for our CO2 emissions nor ratios of CO2 to production, financial results or employee headcount, as we do not believe that reporting a normalised figure meaningfully contributes to an understanding of our performance. The scope and diversity of our products make a single production figure impossible to calculate and our financial results are impacted by commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, which are outside of our control. In addition, due to the nature of the exploration, development and the production cycle, our CO2 emissions do not necessarily correlate to our employee headcount."
"Investec is promoting sustainability as part of its core strategy and believes there needs to be a balance between economic and financial imperatives, the needs of society and their combined impact on the environment. Our commitment to sustainability recognises the interconnected nature of our business, the economy, the environment and society. Within our operations we support efforts to limit global warming to less than 2 C above pre-industrial levels; and to transition to a low carbon economy. We have achieved net-zero carbon emissions in our global operations and committed to ongoing carbon neutrality for our operational footprint."

We also recognize that we can play an important role in working with others to address key social and economic challenges facing clients and communities. goal to lend, facilitate and invest $100 billion toward activities that reduce the impacts of climate change and create environmental solutions that benefit people and communities."
"UBS is also involved in other activities to reduce gaps in climate-related financial data. We support the CDP, as an investor member as well as a questionnaire respondent, in their aim to improve company disclosure of risks and op- por tunities related to natural resources. We were also on the advisory panel of the Natural Capital Finance Alliance's advancing environmental management project. The pro- ject tool ENCORE, which maps how industry sectors depend on nature, was launched in November 2018."
"For NN Group’s own assets, too, we look for investments that have a positive impact on society while still meeting our investment criteria. For instance, we invest in green bonds, and finance infrastructure debt projects in the area of renewable energy and resource efficiency (specifically: solar and windfarms, district heating projects, and water and wastewater treatment facilities). In total, these investments amounted to EUR 821 million at year-end 2019."
"More recently, we have seen some shift in rhetoric on environmental and social issues by the mainstream financial community. However, the voting records of many fund managers tell a different story. Nearly across the board, the largest fund managers tend to vote in line with management recommendations and generally support very few shareholder proposals, which typically advocate for sustainable and responsible business practices. For example, a recent study by Ceres found that, particularly around the topics of climate change, some of the largest managers have among the worst voting records in the fund industry."
"The analysis assumed all borrowers in each sector would be impacted by a similar downgrade, which is unlikely to occur due to different degrees of resiliency to severe weather across companies and facilities in different geographic areas. Even under this form of stress testing, our CET1 would remain above regulatory minimums, including applicable buffers."
"deutscheboerse-2019-tcfd-governance Since the financial crisis of 2007/2008 the importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (Environmental, Social, Governance) information as part of the comprehensive assessment of the medium to long-term forecast of a company's success has been steadily increasing."
"Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, including as a result of global warming, have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. In particular, the consequences of climate change are expected to significantly impact the insurance industry, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions, and need for new insurance products, all of which may create unforeseen risks not currently known to us."
"We have undertaken an analysis of the impact to our business model of transitional scenarios where decarbonisation goals are, or are not, met. The details of this are presented in the scenarios section of this disclosure."
"Advisory Services continue to be an important part of our business. We anticipate 528 new assignments in 2019, about the same level as 2018, to support €45 billion in investments. We are committed to dedicating at least 25% of own-lending capacity to climate projects annually, and to increasing from 25% to 35% the share of financing for developing countries dedicated to climate action. We have committed to financing a total of $100 billion in climate action investments globally from 2016 to 2020. The Bank will also continue to focus on infrastructure projects, particularly those that reduce waste and preserve resources."
"EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES The Panel recognizes that CEMEX has exposure to the risk of increased costs linked to carbon regulations, based on its focus on cement production, which is clearly highly carbon-intensive. Adding to this risk, the Panel asserts that ca. 80% of the company’s assets are located in locations with existing or impending carbon regulations. This reality elevates CEMEX’s overall level of risk in this area relative to peers."
"Developing Innovative New Metrics In 2019, we developed new metrics to assess our credit exposure to carbon-related industries, as defined by TCFD. To do so, we participated in an industry working group that brought together Canadian financial institutions to discuss TCFD-related disclosures. We used the metrics identified to assess our gross credit exposures to carbon-related assets, as well as to power generation by energy source."
We are planning to further define targets and limits so as to ensure that ABN AMRO's vulnerability to climate risks in both the short and longer term remains in line with a moderate risk profile.
"We have initiatives in place to optimize road transport operations. With our in-vehicle monitoring systems (IVMSs), we monitor critical aspects of driver behavior such as speeding, harsh acceleration and braking, and excessive cornering. In Europe, the IVMS is complemented with a load optimization initiative that aims to minimize and, when possible, avoid empty trips. These measures not only have a significant impact on reducing fuel consumption, but also improve our road safety performance and customer service."
"As a first step towards performing a proper scenario analysis, UniCredit is partnering with the global think tank 2 Investment Initiative (2 ii) in road-testing their Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology in a pool of 17 international banks. Originally developed to assess the exposure of both equity and bond portfolios to transition technologies across key sectors, a research programme to expand the model to the banks' corporate lending portfolios has been launched by 2 ii ."
"Future intent We continually review our metrics and targets, as needed, to ensure that the data we are measuring is meaningful, aligns with our strategy, and is providing the information the business and our stakeholders need to effectively monitor our performance and demonstrate our progress. In 2020/21, we will be laying out our pathway to achieve our net zero by 2050 emission reductions and setting targets to align our ambitions and provide better visibility to our progress."
"On February 8, 2018, the Government of Canada introduced legislation to revise the process for assessing major resource projects. If the legislation is passed in its current form, we believe it would have adverse impacts on pipeline companies, particularly in relation to the regulatory review process for proposed new projects that are “designated projects”, by making overall timelines for the development and execution of these projects longer and significantly increasing uncertainty."
"As a result, the following training has been carried out: BBVA'S SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS COURSE with corporate relationship managers AD-HOC TRAINING for employees of the business segments Sustainability training at BBVA is an ongoing effort."

The following additional restrictions are in place for clients active in mountaintop removal mining (MTR): Barclays does not directly finance MTR projects or developments; We apply EDD to financing facilities involving clients which practice MTR.
"Other regulatory risks entail litigation risk and potential direct regulations in line with increasing carbon neutrality ambitions in various jurisdictions, such as the EU’s European Green Deal. Climate-related policy changes may also reduce access to prospective geographical areas for future exploration and production. Disruptive developments may not be ruled out, possibly triggered by severe weather events affecting public perception and policy making."
"In July 2020, BlackRock provided comments to the Department of Labor's proposed rule on 'Financial Factors in Selecting Plan Investments' (the 'DoL Proposal') highlighting our concern that the DoL Proposal could interfere with plan fiduciaries' abilities and willingness to consider financially material Environmental, Social, and Governance factors. BlackRock provided recommendations that aimed at helping the Department of Labor improve the DoL Proposal, while mitigating the potential burdens the DoL Proposal would have placed on plan fiduciaries. We were pleased to see several of our suggestions incorporated into the final rule."
"Building on our history of energy efficiency improvements, we substantially increased our commitment to renewable energy in 2020, committing to 100% renewable electricity for US operations which accounts for over half of our global electrical load."
"Uncertainty around the evolution of the wholesale market design, given the current challenges: • Marginal remuneration system not adjusted to the current context of growing penetration of fixed cost technologies (renewables, backup, storage). • Growing penetration of technologies with 0 marginal cost (reducing prices and increasing prices’ volatility). • Uncertainty around the returns of the conventional generation, in particular as backup capacity (relevant in a perspective of ensuring security of supply). • Volatile context, not suitable for long-term investments necessary to the modernization, decarbonization and security of supply."
"27TAIHEIYO CEMENT REPORT 2020 ince introducing a WHR power generation system at its Kumagaya plant in Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture in 1982, the company has installed similar facilities in its other plants in Japan. These systems generate power by recovering thermal energy from high-temperature exhaust gas generated in the cement calcination process and contribute significantly to the reduction of CO emissions. In October 2019 the company decided to install a WHR power generation facility incorporating a cutting-edge waste heat recovery boiler at its Saitama plant in Hidaka City, Saitama Prefecture. This facility is scheduled to begin operations in September 2022, marking the completion of the initiative to install waste heat power generation systems at all six company plants. The operation of these facilities is expected to help reduce CO emissions by approximately 27,000 tonnes per"
"Among the important risks identified in STEP 1, we recognize rising raw material prices due to a decline in the harvest of agricultural materials and increased costs owing to the introduction of a carbon tax, which have a particularly high impact on our businesses. We therefore evaluated this business impact as follows."
"Climate change presents an evolving set of risks and opportunities for Coles, and has the potential to contribute to and increase the exposure of other material risks. These include increased frequency/intensity of extreme weather events and chronic climate changes which can disrupt our operations and compromise the safety of our team members, customers, supply chain and the food we sell; changes to government policy, law and regulation, which can result in increased costs to operate and potential for litigation; and failure to meet expectations of stakeholders resulting in reputational damage."

"To tackle ground emissions, we have been actively converting our fleet of owned conventional ground support equipment (GSE) to electric alternatives (eGSE). In line with the Opportunities Escalation Process, this was first identified as an opportunity for large-scale conversion in 2014. We then started a trial at JFK International Airport in 2015. Despite initial skepticism about electric vehicles before the trial, 70% of crewmembers using the vehicles preferred electric over conventional, as they offered similar or better technical performance with less noise and no fumes."
"Climate change-related risks may also adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold or lead to increased credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with, including reinsurers. In addition, our reputation or corporate brand could be negatively impacted as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate change. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change on our business and results of operations."

"44 National Australia Bank delayed in the 2020 financial year, due to COVID-19, but is expected to be completed in the 2021 financial year. - Climate Measurement Standards Initiative (CMSI) - The Group joined and supported this cross-sector industry initiative which formed in the 2020 financial year. The CMSI includes representatives from across the banking, insurance and investment sectors alongside pre-eminent Australian climate scientists working together under the auspices of the National Environmental Science Program's Earth Systems and Climate Change (ESCC) Hub, professional services firms and finance sector industry bodies. The objectives of the CMSI are to provide open- source voluntary guidelines for financial institutions (banks, insurers and asset managers and owners) with consistent scientific and technical guidance on how to assess the physical risk of climate-related damage to homes, buildings and other critical infrastructure arising from extreme weather events - such as tropical cyclones, bushfires and floods. The CMSI focused on supporting implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations in addition to better understanding the financial system's exposures to climate-related risks. Two key reports were published in the 2020 financial year, including a finance report and a science report which are available at: https://www.cmsi.org.au/reports - Climate-KIC Australia (Climate-KIC) - The Group has been working with Climate-KIC and a number of other organisations, including government agencies and industry bodies on an Adaptation Finance Project. This project is exploring how the financial sector can invest in climate adaptation to deliver commercial returns and greater climate resilience with a view to developing insights into the creation of a scalable approach to adaptation finance. In 2020, the project completed a report that shares insights and makes recommendations for current and future projects focused on addressing the adaptation finance gap. This work has contributed to the adaptation finance discourse in Australia - the report is available at: https://climate-kic.org.au/our-projects/ adaptation-finance-project/ - Resilience Investment Vehicle (RIV) - The Group has been working with IAG, CSIRO and a number of other government agencies, industry groups and not-for-profits on a RIV.

"STRATEGY (S) a. Identifying and managing cli- mate-related risks and opportuni- ties with different time perspec- tives The most significant and largest-impact cli- mate risks and opportunities are related to our investment assets. In terms of our own operations, the impacts are minor. Indirect risks mainly arise through our customers' business."
"As a global company, we have a role and responsibility that extends even beyond the world of health. We are making progress to minimize our environmental impact and maintain resilient global operations by continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions —down 48% since 2008— and water consumption. We remain committed to reducing waste and increasing the use of renewable energy in alignment with our bold new sustainability goals for 2030."
"BNP Paribas conducted two studies in 2019 to as- sess the resilience of its loan books to transition risks and physical risks. - The Industry Research Department (EIS) of the Group Risk Department performed an internal analysis on five-year energy and climate-related risks, physical risks and transition risks. This report is part of the Group's standard analysis of syste- mic risks, inter alia in the context of the analyses conducted by EIS on the impact of different risk factors on economic sectors. The purpose of the analysis was to identify and assess the main en- ergy transition and climate change risks incurred by BNP Paribas. It notably examined the impact of climate change on sovereign risk and the more or less significant exposure of various economic sectors to energy transition risks and opportuni- ties. This broad, detailed study found BNP Pari- bas' business model to be resilient to these risks, with respect to: o its businesses, and the sector and geographic classifications of its portfolios; o the measures taken to mitigate these risks. - For the first time, in 2019 and with the help of external specialists, BNP Paribas performed an assessment, on a sample of clients in its portfolio, of physical risks covering the consequences of cli- mate change (extreme weather events) on the as- sets of Group clients. They generate financial risks for companies not only through direct impacts on their assets, but also in terms of indirect impacts through their supply chains and markets. For each counterparty analysed, the final score of exposure to physical risks is based on three risk factors: operational risks, supply chain risks (upstream) and risks of market share losses (downstream)."
"In addition to its efforts to develop sustainable products and services, the Bank has identified opportunities to be greener in its operations. The actions we have taken to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings have enabled us to currently exceed regulatory requirements and meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Over the past 20 years, the Bank has voluntarily adopted various measures to considerably improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated. This year, the Bank has set a target to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025. This science-based target aims to help limit global warming to 1.5 C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement."
"In addition to the board, the DLC SEC (a board appointed committee) takes responsibility for monitoring the nonfinancial elements of sustainability, specifically the group's performance in terms of social, environmental (including climate change) and governance (ESG) indicators. Extreme events are assessed, and mitigating actions are considered within the risk appetite framework. Climate considerations are integrated into multidisciplinary, company-wide management processes throughout the group. The DLC SEC is also responsible for promoting the relevance and importance of sustainability, climate issues and sustainable development across the group."
"In September 2018, together with Index Initiative and the United Nations Foundation, we launched the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) on the eve of the General Debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The WBA publishes free and transparent benchmarks ranking companies on contributions towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim is to increase transparency and accountability for businesses in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals as well as empower consumers, investors, governments and civil society organisations by providing them with free and publicly available data that shows a company's Sustainable Development Goal performance, which they can use when deciding where to spend their money, allocate their investments or direct their policy and advocacy efforts. The WBA will develop a range of corporate benchmarks by 2023 to comprehensively assess the progress of 2,000 companies across major areas of transformation required to achieve the SDGs. The first set of benchmarks will be published in 2020 and will address food and agriculture, climate and energy, digital inclusion and gender equality and empowerment."
"The scientific community has concluded that increasing global average temperatures produces significant physical effects, such as the increased frequency and severity of hurricanes, storms, droughts, floods or other extreme climatic events that could interfere with Eni’s operations and damage Eni’s facilities. Extreme and unpredictable weather phenomena can result in material disruption to Eni’s operations, and consequent loss of or damage to properties and facilities, as well as a loss of output, loss of revenues, increasing maintenance and repair expenses and cash flow shortfall."
"We have imposed restrictions on providing loans, advice and insurance to controversial and socially sensitive sectors and activities such as: the energy sector, project finance, arms-related activities, narcotic crops, gambling, fur, palm oil production, mining, deforestation, land acquisition and involuntary resettlement of indigenous populations, tobacco, mining, animal welfare and prostitution."
"Since the Fund is a small organisation, where several senior executives are directly involved in climate work, the executive management is judged to have a good knowledge of the work that is taking place. Thus, the Fund has god opportunities to assess and manage cli- mate-related risks and opportunities."
"Across all our businesses our plans include targets and commitments to manage our own environmental impact, with £530 million of investment planned across Electricity and Gas Transmission. We have committed to reducing NOx emissions from our gas compressors, and achieving net zero construction emissions by 2025/26. We are targeting investments to replace leaking SF6 (an insulating gas and source of GHG emissions) equipment to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, phasing out the procurement of new assets containing SF6 and introducing SF6 free technologies."
"ING has the opportunity to achieve greater impact through our clients. So far, under our Terra approach we have defined sector-level climate metrics and targets such as technology change and emissions-intensity reduction to align our lending portfolio with the Paris Agreement. The approach focuses on the most climate-relevant sectors as measured by their global carbon footprint (i.e. those sectors responsible for approximately 75% of total global emissions). To do so, we apply multiple technologies, with the two primary ones being the PACTA approach for corporate lending and the"
"Greenhouse gas Mitigation Measures Our five year Greenhouse gas mitigation plan consists of three key elements - Energy Efficiency (Reduce), Renewable Energy (RE) Purchase (Replace) and Travel Substitution (Reduce and Replace); of this, RE procurement will contribute the maximum, 80% share to Greenhouse gas emission mitigation strategy for Scope 1 and 2."
"We want to contribute to the transition to the circular economy. The linear economy is not sustainable: we throw out a great deal (waste and therefore raw materials, experience, social capital and knowledge) and therefore discard value. This is not viable from an economic and ecological perspective. As investor we can ‘direct’ companies and with our network, our scale and our influence we can help the movement towards a circular future (creating a sustainable society) further along."
Work on our approach to becoming a net zero carbon business will include the development of new targets to replace and supplement our existing ones. These will be set and made public during the current financial year.
"The Group faces many other risks which, although important and subject to regular review, have been assessed as less significant and are not listed here. These include, for example, natural catastrophe and business interruption risks and certain financial risks. A summary of financial risks and their management is provided on page 33."
"The Group is a major provider of non-retail loans. A key step in credit risk due diligence for non-retail lending is the assessment of potential transactions for environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, including climate risk, through our ESG Risk Assessment Tool. All Institutional Bank loans, as well as large loans in other business units, are evaluated through the Group’s compulsory ESG risk assessment process. The risk of climate change is assessed at origination and during the annual review process for Institutional Bank loans. Exposures with medium or high risk profile are subject to additional due diligence and heightened consideration and assessment in the credit process. During the year ended 30 June 2020, the Group recognised provisions for impairment of $90 million reflecting the impact of extreme weather events on the credit quality of the Group’s loan portfolio."
"An event occurred on 3 July 2019, which resulted in an official caution being issued to AGLM on 21 April 2020. The event, which occurred at the Bayswater Power Station, involved oil leaking into the power station cooling water system. The official caution was issued for an alleged failure to comply with a licence condition that required plant and equipment to be maintained and operated in a proper and efficient condition and manner, respectively."
"Barclays recognises that MTR in the Appalachian region of the USA is a legal mining method, overseen by a robust regulatory framework. MTR has also, however, been subject to intense political, judicial and regulatory debate over the last decade, due to its negative environmental and social impacts on one hand, and positive local benefits on the other."
"A group of 80 employees, from all Group bu- siness lines and regions (many working di- rectly with major BNP Paribas clients), was created to share best practices Groupwide with the aim of seizing on as many energy transition opportunities as possible together."
"For NN’s residential mortgage portfolio, we analysed physical risks. Physical risks for mortgages in the Netherlands are mainly related to damage caused to properties by flooding events (including surface water flooding caused by heavy rainfall, river flooding, and coastal flooding). These events could either lead to a value decrease of collateral and/or impact on the ability of a houseowner to pay their mortgage."
"Climate action lines: In 2018, CaixaBank signed an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) consisting of a line of credit amounting to EUR 30 million to fund investments in SMEs, individuals, and the public sector to combat climate change (e.g., electric cars, modifications to facilities, and home improvements). In addition, CaixaBank acts as a broker for EIB funds related to renewable energy projects. Specifically, in 2018, EUR 35 million have been allocated to finance a wind farm project."
"During 2015, we emitted 23.4 million tonnes of Scope 1 (direct) CO2e emissions mainly from fuel usage. Our Scope 2 (indirect) CO2 emissions, totalled 13.7 million tonnes. Our Scope 3 emissions include emissions from a broad range of sources, including shipping, land transportation by third parties and the use of our energy products."

And through philanthropic giving, which will increase SCANA’s community giving by $1 million per year over the next five years, we expect to focus on education, environmental stewardship and community needs."
"Megatrend As the world’s population becomes increasingly urbanized, infrastructure development and renewal will be unable to keep up, and major social issues such as housing shortages, traffic paralysis, and air pollution will only worsen. In newly emerging nations, environmental awareness will increase as the economy grows, and investments into environmental measures will proceed at the national and the global levels."
The AIETI will focus on ve supply chains critical to achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goals ('well-below two degrees Celsius and striving for 1.5 degrees Celsius') given their signicance to global emissions and their relatively higher abatement costs.
"We have enhanced our Environmental, Social, and Governance heat map to include proxy climate risk metrics. This heat map is available to our analysts and fund managers and updated on a monthly basis. It includes a composite carbon exposure metric based on the carbon-intensity of business activities, the extent of operations in jurisdictions with stringent carbon emissions regulations and the quality of a company’s carbon management. We targeted a £500 million annual investment in low-carbon infrastructure from 2015-2020, and an associated carbon saving target of 100,000 CO2e tonnes annually. In 2017, we signed £527.5 million of new investment into wind, solar, biomass and energy efficiency. Aviva holds over £744 million in green bonds."
"We explain this by UBS's relatively small lending book in climate-sensitive-sectors (see 'UBS corporate lending to climate- sensitive sectors 2019' further below) and availability of insurance where we have relevant exposures to such sectors (e.g., Swiss mortgage lending book)."
"The impact of climate change may over time affect the operations of the Group and the markets in which the Group operates. This could include physical risks such as acute and chronic changes in weather and/or transitional risks such as technological development, policy and regulatory change, and market and economic responses. Efforts to address climate change through laws and regulations, for example by requiring reductions in emissions of GHGs such as CO2, can create economic risks and uncertainties for the Group’s businesses. Such risks could include the cost of purchasing allowances or credits to meet GHG emissions caps, the cost of installing equipment to reduce emissions to comply with GHG limits or required technological standards, decreased profits or losses arising from decreased demand for the Group’s goods and higher production costs resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of legislative or regulatory controls. Manifestation of these increased costs may increase the underlying cost of production of the Group’s products which may adversely impact the financial performance of the Group."
"The stress test conducted on the IEA SDS scenario has shown the overall stability of the book values of the assets with a 7% reduction of the fair value assuming non-deductibility of the costs of Carbon dioxide erability of Carbon dioxide emissions, that is 2% in the event of recognition of the contractual and fiscal recovcharges."
"In 2013, Nationwide identified a gap in how and when lenders collect data regarding the mortgage security property, which impacts risk management and the customer journey. This often means that consideration of environmental risks on the property is limited and only takes place after the mortgage offer has been issued through the conveyancing process, which can be inconsistent and is reviewed by a professional who is not qualified in this area."
"Climate change potentially has multiple effects that could harm the Group’s operations. The increasing scarcity of water resources may negatively affect the Group’s operations in some regions of the world, high sea levels may harm certain coastal activities, and the multiplication of extreme weather events may damage offshore and onshore facilities. These climate risk factors are continually assessed in the risk management and prevention plans."
"Scentre Group has a Responsible Business Group, comprised of members of the Executive Team and subject matter experts that are leading initiatives as part of our Sustainable Business Framework. Membership reflects accountability for the delivery of initiatives that contribute to our primary environmental target of Net Zero Emissions by 2030."
"In 2018, we announced the selection of the Airbus A220 aircraft as the replacement for our existing Embraer 190 aircraft. This selection of a new aircraft before the full useful life of older aircraft had expired was driven in part by our fuel and greenhouse gas emissions efficiency strategy. It is highly unusual for an airline to replace its entire fleet halfway through its expected lifespan, but the improved fuel efficiency and cost savings made this the clear choice. This asset shift brings the potential of an estimated 40% fuel efficiency improvement per seat and an equivalent reduction in carbon emissions, contributing to an estimated 30% decrease in operating cost per seat."
"The Group is connected to all parts of the economy through its lending and other banking activities and considers it has an important role to play in financing the low-carbon transition. Therefore, in the 2020 financial year, the Group sought to calculate the Scope 3 emissions associated with key segments of its lending portfolio - residential mortgages, commercial real estate (office and retail), agriculture, power generation and resources (including coal, oil and gas). The objective was to better understand what might be required to align the Group's lending portfolio to the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and a net zero emissions economy by 2050."
"Emissions generated by the consumption of fuels derived from helicopter and ship transport services (from the plant to the platform of the Gaviota and Castor underground storage facilities). Emissions generated by the consumption of fuels derived from the contracting of surveillance services and air, maritime and land maintenance. Emissions generated by the consumption of fuel in rented vehicles, cranes and suppliers’ hoists."
"Absolute coal threshold Coal assets are particularly carbon-intensive and susceptible to stranded asset risk given the long life of these assets, as well as the evolving regulations on carbon emissions. To ensure we actively manage such risks, we implemented an absolute coal threshold to identify large carbon emitters with a diversified business mix, where relative thresholds may provide inadequate guidance. Our willingness to tackle climate change challenges is reflected in our new, 2019 commitment to not invest in mining companies producing at least 20 million tonnes of coal per year and power utility generators with more than 10 gigawatts of installed coal fire capacity."

Eni's capex for the 2018-2021 four-year period amount to more than €1.8 billion, including R&D costs to support path to decarbonization."
"- For the first time, in 2019 and with the help of external specialists, BNP Paribas performed an assessment, on a sample of clients in its portfolio, of physical risks covering the consequences of climate change (extreme weather events) on the assets of Group clients."
"In terms of physical risks, extreme weather events such as typhoons and floods have the potential to become more serious. Such events could lower production capacity at the Group’s manufacturing bases and trigger an increase in costs from damages. Moreover, in regions where there is a heightened water risk owing to fluctuations in rainfall, production activity at our manufacturing bases may be limited by restrictions on water use as a result of drought."
"Finally, prolonged and multiple periods of heatwaves or other consequences of rising temperatures may result in increased mortality and morbidity, thereby impacting our life and income insurance liabilities. Long-term threats are difficult to predict, but at this time, we expect this to have less impact on our life and income insurance liabilities than other risks, such as changes in demographics or pandemics. It should be noted though that whilst pandemic outbreaks can be attributed to a number of interrelated factors, climate change is likely to increase the risks by spreading of disease vectors into areas that formerly did not experience these."
"Climate change Climate change exposes UPM to variety of risks, that can be considered strategic, operational, hazard or financial. Strategic risks are related to competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation and subsidies may distort raw material and final product markets, and costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM’s financial performance. However, transition to low-carbon economy should bring business opportunities to UPM’s renewable and recyclable products. Operational risks can be related to supply chain, availability and price of major inputs. Climate change may also cause operational or hazard risk related to exceptional weather events such as more severe storms, floods and draughts resulting in e.g. unpredictable wood harvesting conditions and hydro power availability. Climate change may also contribute to financial risks such as electricity price."

"In line with this action plan, in 2014 we set the target of “achieving a five-fold increase in value created in terms of climate change countermeasures through the provision of NEC products and services compared to the CO2 emissions from NEC’s supply chain,” and proceeded to carry out initiatives. During fiscal 2019, the value was six times, with a contribution of 33.58 megatons for an mitigation, targeting a reduction of 23 megatons by fiscal 2021, expanding to 50 megatons by fiscal 2031. Moreover, we will reduce CO2 emissions from our own business operations by improving efficiency and shifting to renewable energy. environmental load of 5.62 megatons, representing a significant improvement from 3.5 times in fiscal 2018. This reflects a stronger approach to our suppliers and an increase in provision of disaster measure-related solutions by domestic subsidiaries."

"The future of heat is uncertain, and its decarbonisation is reliant on relatively nascent technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture usage and storage, as well as biogas and heat pumps. These new and evolving technologies will need to be used in new contexts and on a scale that has not yet been demonstrated. We do not believe that any of these technologies can, in the next 30 years, reach sufficient scale to represent an existential threat to our gas businesses."
"Because our electric grid will continue to rely on high-voltage and lower-voltage power lines, we expect to invest about $800 million annually for the foreseeable future to build new transmission infrastructure, replace more than 2,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, and upgrade physical security at substations. The rebuilds will increase the capacity on our transmission lines, which in part enhances our ability to transport more renewable energy."
"At CEMEX, we are seeking to invest in upgrading our cement plants, trying to maximize the use of alternative fuels to power our kilns and transition away from fossil fuels. In 2019, we pledged more than US$50 million to invest in an innovative global program to replace fossil fuels with alternative fuels.

The impact of climate change on pandemic risk is also being explored, but as of today no clear link has been demonstrated."
10 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios are named based on the hypothetical radiative forcing level (the portion of energy transmitted to the earth that is trapped within its atmosphere) of the earth at the end of the century.
Sydney Airport's contribution to climate change solutions will also present new opportunities. These include: - Supporting the move to a carbon-constrained world by working with airline partners to provide infrastructure to support further electrification and low emission fuels - Integrating climate adaptation opportunities into community investment strategies aimed at supporting the resilience of our communities and their support for our activities - Lower operating costs by reducing energy consumption.
"Growing concerns over air quality, road safety, sustainability and urban congestion, among consumers and society at large, are driving the regulations and policies for motor vehicles and urban development. These will impact choice of fuel, ownership patterns and will have a signicant impact on the future of the automotive industry."
"We have and could suffer losses due to operational risks Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It also includes, among other things, reputational risk, technology risk, model risk and outsourcing risk, as well as the risk of business disruption due to external events such as natural disasters, environmental hazard, damage to critical utilities, and targeted activism and protest activity. While we have policies, processes and controls in place to manage these risks, these may not always have been, or continue to be effective."
"The downsides of disruptive technology have been apparent in other engagements. The Forum’s discussions with Tesla, a company that potentially will play a central role in decarbonising the car industry, have focused on health and safety concerns about their Freemont car plant. Despite introducing new technologies on the production line, reports have suggested that incident rates are higher than their competitors. There have been similar concerns that employment standards and health and safety records have been worse in new industries, including in the renewable energy sector."
"Staff Working Paper on risk differential of brown vs. green assets, published in January 2020. This finds evidence of a risk differential: mortgages against energy-efficient properties are less frequently in payment arrears than mortgages against energy-inefficient properties."
The ESG Sustainability Council pulls together the geographical business scopes led by our three EVP Zone CEOs and functional leadership at the Executive Board level. It meets every month and reports progress to the full Executive Board monthly.
"The tool does this by tracking the generation technology capacity mix for the power companies that we lend to, as well as for forecasts of the change in that mix at those companies over the near-term."
"In 2019, we: • provided a $43 million green loan to Sunseap Group to fund its installation of solar photovoltaic systems on the rooftops of 210 sites ranging from commercial and industrial to government premises. The 37 megawatt-peak solar power systems can generate enough energy to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 tonnes per year; and • rolled out U-Solar, Asia’s first solar industry ecosystem that connects businesses and consumers across the solar power value chain."
"Company may not be able to offset such impact, including, for example, through higher freight rates. Climate change legislation and regulation could also affect CN's customers; make it difficult for CN's customers to produce products in a cost-competitive manner due to increased energy costs; and increase legal costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change."
"We recognise that global warming is an existential threat to humanity and one that we collectively can take steps to address. However, this is not a simple issue and we wish to take action that both meets our legislative requirements and is effective. We note that carbon dioxide produced from coal is not the only, or even the most potent, source of greenhouse gas emissions. Any company that sources energy from coal fired (or gas fired for that matter) energy generation is to some extent complicit in and contributing to the problem. This also extends to governments that do not regulate or factor in the costs from the damage that greenhouse gas emissions cause. As such, the list of contributors to the problem extends to almost the full range of our potential investment universe. Further, shutting down all coal supplies to coal fired power plants overnight would cause blackouts in many countries around the world and severely affect energy infrastructure. Electric grid systems that can only manage with a high percentage of base load power are another contributing factor."
"The BoM reports regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board on business development, the company’s financial position and earnings, planning and achievement of objectives, business strategy, and risk exposure. Climate-related issues are part of these regular updates where relevant."
"Last year the Aviva Foundation in the UK invested unclaimed assets of shareholders through grants and social enterprise investments. In 2019 the Foundation has now committed to giving £3.7 million to nine non-profit organisations and social enterprises that, working with our business, can support our communities and vulnerable customers. This has included funding counselling for vulnerable home insurance customers who experience trauma following serious events such as flooding."
We embrace our responsibility to understand and manage our own carbon footprint. Our approach is to limit and minimise our direct carbon impact and create awareness to encourage positive sustainable behaviour. We have achieved net-zero carbon emissions status in February 2020 within our global operations and committed to ongoing carbon neutrality in all our direct global operations. Over the short-term we are looking into sourcing our energy from renewable sources.
"Our identified short, medium and long-term climate-related risks On-balance sheet activities Given our balance sheet exposure we have not identified material climate-related risks (physical or transition) over the short (2 years), medium (3-7 years) and long term ( 7 years)."
"In addition, we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. We understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions, particularly if the frequency and severity of natural catastrophic events continue to increase. Because there is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact our business."
"We have defined key sustainability areas in our 5-Year Business Plan in line with the expectations and requirements of stakeholders and based on the importance and affinity of such initiatives with our strategy, as well as on the medium- to long-term impact on our corporate value. Based on this, each in-house company, unit, and group will establish a strategy incorporating sustainability initiatives. Additionally, we have set targets/KPIs based on our key sustainability areas. The key sustainability areas and other items are revised each fiscal year and reflected into our business plan."
"Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and environmental protection orders. The costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Non-compliance with environmental regulations could have an adverse impact on Cenovus’s reputation. There is also a risk that Cenovus could face litigation initiated by third parties relating to climate change or other environmental regulations."
"Shimizu launched the company-wide, cross-organizational Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Working Group to extract and categorize the risks and oppor- tunities presented by these transitions and physical changes as impacts on each level: procurement, direct operations, and product demand. The Working Group analyzed the impact and the response of the Shimizu Group. While the quantitative impact has not been calculated, the relative impact on business activities was predicted and expressed as three levels: Large, Medium, and Small."
"A reduction in GHG emissions relies on the commercial viability and scalability of emission reduction strategies and related technology and products. In the event that we are unable to implement these strategies and technologies as planned without negatively impacting our expected operations or cost structure, or such strategies or technologies do not perform as expected, we may be unable to meet our GHG 2030 targets or 2050 ambition on the current timelines, or at all."
"The Alberta Climate Leadership Plan, sets forth several commitments relevant to the oil and gas sector: (1) the implementation of an economy-wide carbon levy; (2) limiting of oil sands emissions to a province-wide total of 100 megatonnes per year (compared to current industry emissions levels of approximately 70 megatonnes per year), with certain exceptions for cogeneration power sources and new upgrading capacity; and (3) a goal to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas activities by 45 percent by 2025. The economy-wide carbon levy is based on a rate of $30 per tonne for 2018 and exempts activities integral to oil and gas production processes until 2023."
"The two companies and the relevant local authorities had already created 1,088 car-pooling spaces between 2014 and 2018. They will step up their efforts in this area with a motorway investment plan that was approved by the French government in early November 2018. APRR has undertaken to create 1,700 car-pooling spaces at 27 sites by 2021, investing a total of €10.6 million, while AREA will invest €1.7 million to create 250 spaces at five sites in the same timeframe."
"Medium-Term Business Plan 2017 includes a capital expenditure plan of ¥400 billion over five years as a means of “preparing the way for the future” to achieve our Vision for the Future. As of the end of FY2020.3, we have invested ¥273.4 billion cumulatively. In FY2021.3, we will continue investing in our real estate leasing business and renewable energy business. We will also be actively investing in R&D of construction technologies (such as building next-generation production systems) and digital transformation to dramatically raise productivity. We are also stepping up alliances with startups that have leading-edge technology."
"Net CO2 emissions (kg per ton of cementitious material) Net CO2 emissions are CO2 emissions from the calcination process of the raw materials and the combustion of traditional kiln and non-kiln fuels. Cementitious materials refer to clinker production volumes, mineral components consumed in cement production and mineral components processed and sold externally."
"The impact of climate change presents a significant risk. Damage to assets caused by extreme weather events linked to climate change is becoming more evident, highlighting the fragility of global infrastructure. We also anticipate the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they are in coastal cities."
"E M P L O Y E E E N G A G E M E N T AT PSEG, WE RECOGNIZE that our full workforce must rise to the challenge climate change presents."
"From a business continuity standpoint, MGC has identified production downtime due to drought or flooding of production facilities as a water-related risk, formulated the business continuity plan (BCP) that addresses this risk and implemented measures to mitigate it. None of the areas in which MGC’s plants are located has experienced either adverse impacts on production activities due to water stress or conflicts with stakeholders regarding use of water resources."
"At the company level, WM uses an enterprise risk management (ERM) process involving senior leaders and subject matter experts from all major divisions to assess the materiality of all risks across the enterprise, including climate related risks. Each year the Treasury & Risk Management team performs top-down and bottom-up reviews across all headline risk areas to assess changes, identify emerging risks and prioritize risks for in-depth analysis. Top-down reviews consist of one-on-one meetings with every member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) as well as select group Area Vice Presidents to get a regional and operations-focused viewpoint on risk. Bottom-up reviews are done in workshop format including all subject matter experts for a given headline risk as well as participants from regional operations. An output from these meetings is a standardized scorecard which includes risk and opportunity ratings for (financial) impact, likelihood (of event), outlook (of risk exposure) and confidence (in risk management). Additionally, forward-looking action plans with measurable indicators and progress on action plans from previous assessments are also discussed & documented. Based on findings from top-down and bottom-up reviews, certain risks are identified as “Priority Risks” and receive a more granular assessment, quantification of impact, and are elevated for further discussion with the SLT and the Board. The executive team that manages our enterprise risk reporting to the Board reviews all submissions for consistency in determining scope of impacts, and comprehensiveness in determining the adequacy of current support by internal staff, the sufficiency of financial support for contractors or mitigation measures needed to manage and reduce risk, sufficiency of legal support, and the extent and sufficiency of third-party consulting support. Moreover, the staff working on the ERM documentation coordinate with those drafting the risk factor description for the Annual Report Form 10-K to assure thoroughness in response. The environmental impacts, risks, and opportunities, including climate-related, associated with our carbon reduction service lines are discussed each year. WM’s Corporate Development & Innovation department briefs the Board at least annually on potentially disruptive technologies, sometimes related to customer expectations with regard to carbon reduction services. Additionally, a cross­ functional team made up of team members from Legal, Sustainability, Recycling, Treasury & Risk Management, Corporate Development and others, meet monthly to discuss business disruptors."
"2 footprint of the portfolio but also an innovative approach to aligning the portfolio with the two degree carbon reduction scenario in the future. - AM engages with companies in which it invests on behalf of clients to discuss approaches to mitigating climate-related risk, as well as actively voting on shareholder resolutions to improve transparency and disclosure around climate-related reporting. Specif- ically in the context of the Climate Aware fund, UBS Asset Management has implemented an engagement program with 50 oil & gas and utilities companies under- weighted in the fund. Dialogue with companies aims at improving companies' disclosure and performance alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations. Engage- ment makes it possible to share the results of the quanti- tative and qualitative assessments included in the fund methodology with investee companies too. This allows for the verification of company performance with additional information collected before and after meetings. It also means AM can collect feedback, explicitly com- municate objectives for change in corporate practices and further enhance the model used to inform the under / overweights in the strategy."
We have developed a Climate Policy Position Statement which outlines our role in limiting climate change to well below two degrees and the way in which we will support the transition to a net zero emissions economy by 2050. This includes undertaking a climate scenario analysis and setting a $15 billion target for financing low carbon projects by 2025.
"To better understand the landscape, Morgan Stanley engaged Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials and its current members in early 2020. We had an opportunity to learn more about their emissions factors database in order to better evaluate how PCAF's data for various assets could be utilized by Morgan Stanley."
"In 2020, we invested £880,000 in delivering over 20 energy efficiency projects including a boiler upgrade, building management systems optimisation, improved lighting controls, and the installation of LEDs. These are expected to result in annual energy savings of 2,250,000 kWh. Over the next 12 months, we will pursue ISO 50001 accreditation at our commercial offices."
"Within our overall risk management categories, we recognise a number of key non-financial risks pertaining to our supply chain, environmental impact, employees, and social issues such as labour rights, human rights and corruption. These risks, as well as others that could emerge in the future, could hinder the company in achieving its strategic and financial objectives. Below we outline some of the most material non-financial risks to our business and performance, along with the main steps we have taken to manage them, while on page 84, we further consider our main climate-related risks and opportunities."
"We emitted 13.4 million tonnes CO2 of Scope 2 (indirect emissions), being emissions arising from our consumption of purchased electricity, steam or heat.
